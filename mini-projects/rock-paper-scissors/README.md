# Rock–Paper–Scissors 🎮

A simple console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game written in Python as part of my **python-daily** mini-projects.  
The player competes against a randomized AI opponent, with real-time scoring and a final result summary.

## Features

- Choose between **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**
- AI selects a random move each round
- Full win/lose/tie logic
- Scoreboard updates after every round
- Quit anytime by typing **'q'**
- Clean, readable structure perfect for beginners

## How to Run

From the project root:

```bash
cd mini-projects/rock-paper-scissors
python rps.py
