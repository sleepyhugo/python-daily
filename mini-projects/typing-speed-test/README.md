# Typing Speed Test ⏱️

A console-based Typing Speed Test that measures how fast and accurately you can type.  
The program presents a random sentence, times how long it takes you to type it, and then calculates:

- **Words Per Minute (WPM)**
- **Accuracy (%)**
- **Correct vs. total words**
- **Total time taken**

This mini project is part of my `python-daily` series where I build small programs to improve my Python skills.


## Features

- Random sentence selection each test  
- Accurate timing using Python's `time` module  
- WPM calculation  
- Word-by-word accuracy analysis  
- Clean results summary  
- Option to replay as many times as you want  


## How to Run

From the project root:

```bash
cd mini-projects/typing-speed-test
python typing_test.py
